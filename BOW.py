- Base Structure: RNA-based retrovirus
- Key Components:
  - Modified Progenitor virus base
  - Ebola-derived RNA sequences
  - Mutated RNA polymerase
  - Variable surface proteins

  - Causes rapid cell division
  - Increases mitochondrial activity
  - Disrupts apoptosis (cell death)
  - Rewrites host DNA
  - Enhances adrenal production

G-Virus (Golgotha)
- Structure: RNA/DNA hybrid virus
- Components:
  - Modified T-Virus base
  - Regenerative enzyme complex
  - Advanced protein synthesis mechanisms
  - Unstable genetic structure
- Cellular Effects:
  - Continuous DNA replication
  - Uncontrolled cell growth
  - Enhanced tissue regeneration
  - Rapid protein synthesis
  - Cellular memory retention

Progenitor Virus
- Structure: Ancient DNA virus
- Key Elements:
  - Natural viral DNA
  - Selective genetic markers
  - Complex protein coat
  - Unique enzyme systems
- Effects:
  - Extreme DNA modification
  - Selective cell death
  - Enhanced cellular energy production
  - Genetic restructuring

Let me create a Python class to model these molecular properties:

```python
class VirusComposition:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.molecular_structure = {}
        self.cellular_effects = []
        self.genetic_markers = []
        self.protein_components = []
        
    def add_molecular_detail(self, component_type, details):
        self.molecular_structure[component_type] = details

def create_t_virus():
    t_virus = VirusComposition("T-Virus")
    
    t_virus.molecular_structure = {
        "base_type": "RNA retrovirus",
        "genome_size": "approximately 13kb",
        "protein_coat": "modified icosahedral",
        "surface_proteins": ["glycoprotein-A", "modified spike protein"],
        "enzymes": ["mutated RNA polymerase", "enhanced reverse transcriptase"]
    }
    
    t_virus.cellular_effects = [
        "increased mitochondrial activity",
        "disrupted apoptosis pathways",
        "enhanced protein synthesis",
        "modified cell division rate",
        "altered hormone production"
    ]
    
    t_virus.genetic_markers = [
        "progenitor_sequence_alpha",
        "modified_ebola_rna",
        "tyrant_gene_complex"
    ]
    
    t_virus.protein_components = [
        {"name": "T-001", "function": "cell membrane modification"},
        {"name": "T-002", "function": "muscle tissue enhancement"},
        {"name": "T-003", "function": "neural pathway alteration"}
    ]
    
    return t_virus

def create_g_virus():
    g_virus = VirusComposition("G-Virus")
    
    g_virus.molecular_structure = {
        "base_type": "RNA/DNA hybrid",
        "genome_size": "approximately 20kb",
        "protein_coat": "adaptive capsid",
        "surface_proteins": ["G-protein complex", "regenerative proteins"],
        "enzymes": ["enhanced DNA polymerase", "mutation catalyst"]
    }
    
    g_virus.cellular_effects = [
        "continuous DNA replication",
        "enhanced cellular regeneration",
        "protein synthesis acceleration",
        "tissue memory retention",
        "adaptive mutation response"
    ]
    
    return g_virus

# Example usage
t_virus = create_t_virus()
g_virus = create_g_virus()

print(f"{t_virus.name} Molecular Structure:")
for component, details in t_virus.molecular_structure.items():
    print(f"- {component}: {details}")

print("\nCellular Effects:")
for effect in t_virus.cellular_effects:
    print(f"- {effect}")
```

Specific Molecular Mechanisms:

1. T-Virus Infection Process:
- Attaches to cell membrane
- Injects viral RNA
- Hijacks cell machinery
- Produces viral proteins
- Modifies cellular metabolism
- Triggers uncontrolled growth

2. G-Virus Unique Features:
- Self-evolving genome
- Adaptive protein synthesis
- Regenerative enzyme production
- Cellular memory preservation
- Mutation acceleration factors

3. Progenitor Molecular Path:
- Selective cell penetration
- DNA modification enzymes
- Enhanced energy production
- Genetic restructuring process
- Cellular adaptation mechanisms

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific molecular aspect or create more detailed models of their biological processes?
