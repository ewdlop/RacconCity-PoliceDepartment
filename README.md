## RPD

The **Raccoon City Police Department (R.P.D.)** is a fictional law enforcement agency prominently featured in the *Resident Evil* series by Capcom. It serves as the central law enforcement agency in Raccoon City, a midwestern American city. The R.P.D. building, with its iconic design, was once a museum and is notable for its elaborate and somewhat impractical layout.

### Key Features:
1. **S.T.A.R.S. Unit**:
   - The R.P.D. is home to the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), a specialized unit trained for high-risk situations.
   - Members like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker played key roles in the storyline, especially regarding the Umbrella Corporation's involvement in biohazards.

2. **Key Personnel**:
   - **Chief Brian Irons**: Corrupt and complicit in Umbrella Corporationâ€™s actions.
   - **Leon S. Kennedy**: A rookie officer who arrives on his first day amid the T-virus outbreak.
   - **Claire Redfield**: Though not an officer, Claire interacts significantly with the R.P.D. during her search for her brother, Chris.

3. **The Building**:
   - Known for its unique architecture, hidden passages, and puzzles, which reflect its history as a former museum.
   - Includes areas like the main hall, underground parking, jail cells, and various offices.

4. **Role in the Outbreak**:
   - The R.P.D. plays a central role in the *Resident Evil 2* and *Resident Evil 3: Nemesis* games, where it becomes a key battleground during the T-virus outbreak.
   - Overrun by zombies and other bio-organic weapons (B.O.W.s), it becomes a site of survival horror for protagonists.

The R.P.D. is a legendary part of the *Resident Evil* series, serving as both a refuge and a death trap for players navigating its many dangers. Would you like a deeper dive into its lore, characters, or role in the games?
